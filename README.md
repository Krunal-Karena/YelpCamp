## 🔍Project Highlights:
During this project, I spent around 120 hours crafting different aspects of the web app. The learning experience was incredibly rewarding. From reading documentation to googling things , I deepened my understanding of Node.js, npm , Express and the power of MongoDB.
Here are some of the key features I implemented:

✅ Node.js & Express : I used Node.js to build the back-end of the web app, and Express as the runtime to handle HTTP requests and routing.

✅ MongoDB & Mongoose : For data storage, I integrated MongoDB Atlas, and I was able to establish one-to-many and many-to-one data relations using Mongoose.

✅ Authentication & Authorization : Security was a top priority. I successfully implemented user authentication and authorization to ensure a safe user experience.

✅ Cloudinary for Image Storage : Leveraging Cloudinary, I allowed users to upload and store images securely on the cloud.

✅ Preventing Security Vulnerabilities : I took extensive measures to protect the app from security threats like Mongo injection and XSS attacks.

✅ EJS as a Template Engine : I used EJS to create dynamic HTML templates and efficiently display content to users.

✅ Leaflet for maps : I used leaflet to design and style the map, ensuring a clean and responsive layout.
